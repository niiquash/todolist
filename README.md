# Overview

This is a simple todo list. In the future, I will be adding some other functionalities. I used django features to run a local server on my computer using django commands, "python manage.py runserver." The landing page of the app is the todo list. Django provide a backend where the I can create a superuser and manage the databases where all the user inputs are stored.

I wrote this software to learn how to build web applications using the python Django framework. I have learned that this framework provides a solid foundation around which super cool looking apps can be developed. It also provide a means to store data in databases, and the ability to run your programs on a local server. I'm going to learn how to deploy my web apps using Django-heroku next.

For this project I was able to complete only one webpage, which is the main todo list landing page. With more practice I will implement more functions to make transitions to other pages.
